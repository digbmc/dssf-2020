### Activity

1. Use command line to navigate to the folder where you're keeping your dssf files  `cd`
2. Create a new directory (folder) for your new site `mkdir my-site`
3. Create a document in the directory and name it 'index.html' `touch my-site/index.html`
4. Create a css document in the same place `touch my-site/style.css`
5. Open the project in Atom
   Try `atom my-site/index.html` - if that doesn't work, open Atom --> File --> Add Project Folder
6. In Atom, type html and hit tab: voila! You have a web page!
7. Add some elements and text. Save it, and open index.html with a web browser. You should see your website.
8. Link your CSS: in the 'head' section of index.html, type this:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
```
9. Now you're ready to build and style your website!
