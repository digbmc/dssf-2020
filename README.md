# About the program

The Digital Scholarship Summer Fellows program is a paid, full-time summer internship opportunity for Bryn Mawr students to learn digital research and publication methods and gain professional experience by collaborating on a public-facing digital scholarship project. Over the course of ten weeks, we will explore key issues and methods in digital scholarship, critical making, and multi-modal research through a combination of hands-on work, instruction, and discussion. Fellows will also have opportunities to present their work, create a personal digital portfolio, and learn about careers in libraries, museums, and digital media and research.

## Project: *'24 '31 Students Study Race*

“'24, '31 Students Study Race” is an archival project about two conferences on race that Bryn Mawr students co-organized in the early-twentieth century. The 1924 conference was a three-day event co-organized by students at Bryn Mawr, Swarthmore, and Penn and held on Swarthmore’s campus. Students—black and white, male and female—from other institutions attended, exchanged ideas, and socialized with one another. The 1931 conference, a one-day event, was organized by Bryn Mawr students and held on Bryn Mawr’s campus. The event featured many prominent speakers of color, including Walter White, head of the NAACP, Alice Dunbar Nelson, poet and member of the Interracial Committee of the Society of Friends, and W. E. B. Du Bois, editor of The Crisis. During the summer, we will create a public-facing website that tells the story of these conferences, with narrative, images, documents, and data. This project will require working with a variety of platforms, methods, and skills, including web design, GIS, data management and visualization, media curation, computational text analysis, writing and editing, and more.
