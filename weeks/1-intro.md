## Thursday, June 4

### Priorities today
- [ ] Choose CMS for our exhibition
- [ ] Develop the project charter

### AM: digital exhibition platforms
- CMS = Content management system
  - Database for organizing and publishing media & text resources and metadata
  - Examples: moodle, wordpress, Drupal, grav
- What kind of CMS do we need?
  - Open source: can be installed (or is already installed) on the DS server
  - Customizable: we are able to design and build the right system for our content and project
  - Support for media metadata
  - Easy to embed external resources (data viz, maps, etc.)
  - Multiple user accounts possible
- Common CMSs  for digital exhibitions
  - [Omeka](https://omeka.org/)
    - Tutorial: [Introduction to Omeka](https://omekagym.omeka.net/items/show/521)
  - [Scalar](https://scalar.me/anvc/scalar/)
    - Tutorial: [Digital Exhibitions with Scalar](bit.ly/arch-399)
  - [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/)
- Alternative to a CMS: [Wax](https://minicomp.github.io/wax/about/), a static website generator designed for exhibits
- What will we do with our platform
  1. Add media resources (documents, images, audio) and metadata
  2. Organize media resources into 'collections', galleries, and other interactive displays
  3. Embed data visualizations, maps, and other external content
  4. Build text essays that feature media resources
  5. Customize the design of our site (using html, css, and javascript)
