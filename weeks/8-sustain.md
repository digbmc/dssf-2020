### Blog post assignment

- Write a post of 500-750 words for the Digital Scholarship blog.
- Your post should be engaging and explore something about your experience in the summer fellows program.
- Please include a catchy title and a few images to accompany it.
- Here's one model:
  1. Tell a story: about project work, about research, about your learning process, about a difficult task, about an experience. Give your reader a detailed sense of what the experience was like for you.
  2. Offer a takeaway: what you learned, how this experience changed your thinking, how it connects to something larger (the project, your interests, etc.)
 - Examples
